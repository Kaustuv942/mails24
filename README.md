A full stack MERN based web app built to schedule mails through gmail. Our web application focuses on sending Recurring emails at an interval of 20s/30s along with the mails weekly, monthly and yearly on a particular time and date.














HOME

Home page shows the list of the upcoming scheduled mails
On clicking a particular item of the list, a modal shows the complete information of the mail including recipients, cc, subject and body.





                  







HISTORY

History page shows the list of the mails which are already sent.
Each list item would consist of the recipient name , subject and timestamp of it last delivery
On clicking a particular item of the list, a modal shows the complete information of the mail including recipients, cc, subject and body.








COMPOSE

Compose Page gives the user 4 options : Recurring, Weekly , Monthly , Yearly
If the user fills in all the details and clicks on the schedule button without choosing any of the options i.e Recurring / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly , then the mail would be treated like a normal mail.
Recurring : The page would give the user two extra options to select the time interval and the number of recurring mails.
Weekly : The page would give the user three extra options to select the day of the week, time and the number of recurring mails.
Monthly : The page would give the user three extra options to select the date of the month, time and the number of recurring mails.
Yearly :  The page would give the user four extra options to select the month , date of the month, time and the number of recurring mails.
